      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The HSE Science and Research Centre is the most comprehensive facility in the world dedicated to the investigation and research of health and safety science.</p>
      <p>It's a true national asset and is the main home of HSE's Science Division—380 scientists, engineers, occupational health and hygiene specialists, and support professionals working together to provide the research and evidence that HSE requires to underpin its regulatory activities, protect people and places, and make Great Britain one of the safest places in the world to work and do business.</p>
      <p>Not only does the science and research we perform support HSE in its role as an evidence-based, world-class regulator, our combination of scientific expertise, real-world experience, and knowledge of the regulatory landscape also helps wider government and industry to solve the health, safety, and wellbeing challenges of their everyday work, as well as in times of crisis.</p>
      <p>It also makes us unrivalled in our ability to assist both public and private sector organisations to research and safely enable the products, processes, and innovative technologies of the future.</p>

        <li>Bringing people and organisations together to work as one</li>
        <li>Keeping pace with future change and innovation</li>
        <li>Valuing our people</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're building a vibrant science community with a strong purpose for public good that will be at the forefront of innovation across health, safety, and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>The HSE Science and Research Centre will be the place where the most creative and innovative scientists and engineers from government, industry, and academia can come together to address some of the biggest challenges on the national agenda.</p>
      <p>From preventing future pandemics, safely enabling net zero energy technologies, or using big data to predict health and safety outcomes across the globe, the HSE Science and Research Centre offers a dynamic environment for applied research, development, and experimentation with the space for collaboration with endless possibilities and potential.</p>

      <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
      <p>The HSE Science and Research Centre has roots stretching back over 100 years. In the early years, safety research in coal mining was our sole business. Since then, we have evolved considerably into a truly modern organisation that is not only internationally acclaimed for its depth and quality of scientific expertise but also for the breadth of disciplines it covers.</p>
      <p>Our long history is extremely valuable—having investigated incidents in virtually every workplace imaginable, we can draw upon extensive cross-sector experience and apply it to solve the challenges of an ever-changing health and safety landscape, as well as anticipate future issues.</p>
